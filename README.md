# Social Team Builder (In progress)

This is the twelfth and final project in the Treehouse Python tech degree.

Will be hosted on Heroku upon completion. To view locally clone the repo, download the 
requirements with ```pip install requirements.txt``` and run ```python manage.py runserver```.

## Description

You're going to build a site where people can sign up to find projects that need help or post their own projects for 
other people to join. 

Users should be able to create a brief profile for themselves after they sign up with an avatar, 
a bio, and pick their skills from a list. Users can post a project, too, giving it a title and description. They should 
also list the positions they need filled for that job with a brief description of what the position will be responsible 
for. Users should be able to find a project and ask to join it. If you're a project owner, you can approve or deny the 
person asking to join.
